# Knapsack Encryption Algorithm
This project implements the Knapsack Encryption Algorithm as a JavaFX desktop application. The Knapsack Encryption Algorithm is an early public key cryptosystem developed by Ralph Merkle and Martin Hellman in 1978.

## Overview
The Knapsack Encryption Algorithm is based on the subset sum problem, a special case of the knapsack problem. It utilizes a superincreasing sequence as the private key and a transformed sequence as the public key.

## Features
Desktop GUI: A user-friendly JavaFX interface for encryption and decryption.
Key Generation: Generates a superincreasing sequence for the private key and computes the corresponding public key.
Encryption: Converts plaintext messages into ciphertext using the public key.
Decryption: Recovers the original plaintext from the ciphertext using the private key.
